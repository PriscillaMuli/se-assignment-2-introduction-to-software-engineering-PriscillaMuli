What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to design, maintenance, operation, and development of software. Software engineering has key components which include requirements planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, maintenance, project management, quality assurance.

A software engineer creates with stakeholders, develops solutions and understands the various software requirements while a programmer understands how to can build software products and knows how to code.

The main differences between the two lie in the scope, methodology, quality, documentation and collaboration.
For the scope : programmers have a narrower focus - they focus on specific tasks such as writing code to solve problems or implementationd details.
Software engineers have a broader focus - they focus on the entire lifecycle of software development and not just on specific tasks.

For the methodology: programmers are more focused on getting the immediate task done and thus utilize adhoc approaches when coding.
Software engineers use structured methodologies for example Devops, Agile development models to ensure that the software is reliable and accurate.

For the quality: programmers have less focus on quality assurance,ensuring that the code can function correctly is of more importance.
Software engineers go through rigorous tests to assure the quality of the software they are providing for the end users.

For the documentation: programmers have minimal documentation as their focus is purely on writing code.
Software engineers place documentation highly and ensure to adhere to high standards.

For the collaboration: programmers work in an individualistic nature without extensively collaborating with others
Software engineers tend to work in a more collaborative nature, working with people in a team.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): it is a framework which outlines the process development teams utilize to build high-quality software. It is a time-saving and cost-effective process. Through forward planning, it ensures that software expectations are met. Some of its benefits include improved risk management, efficient estimation, systematic software delivery and increased visibility of the development process.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

It includes several stages which include: planning, designing, implementing, testing, deploying and maintaining
1. Planning - involves defining the project scope, goals and objectives.  It also entails collecting requirements from stakeholders, resource estimation and scheduling. Making a project plan, feasibility studies and collecting user requirements happens in this stage.

2. Designing - requirements are analyzed in order to identify the best solutions for software creation. The system architecture and detailed design specifications are developed

3. Implementing - the product is coded by the development team. This code is based on the design specifications. The software is written, tested and debugged ensuring it meets the requirements. Smaller coding tasks are identified to achieve the end result.

4. Testing - Automation and manual testing is used in combination to test for bugs. Quality analysis is conducted. Testing includes various levels such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing 

5. Deploying - when the software is finalized,  it is deployed to the production environment because it is ready for release. The deployment phase includes several tasks to move the latest build copy to the production environment, such as packaging, environment configuration, and installation

6. Maintaining - entails ongoing support and updates to the software. The team fixes bugs, resolves customer issues, and manages software changes

Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 

The agile model arranges the SDLC phases into several development cycles, iterating through the phases rapidly, delivering only small, incremental software changes in each cycle.
Its main objective of agile models is delivering working software in frequent iterations giving teams the chance to respond to changing customer needs. Requirements also change with time.

Waterfall model is a sequential approach to software development which has distinct phases that follow one another in a predetermined order. This means that each new phase depends on the outcome of the previous phase. and the design flows from one phase down to the next, similar to a waterfall.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

The key differences include approach to change, customer involvement, delivery method.
Under approach to change, agile greatly encourages flexibility while waterfall is not as flexible or adaptable.Once the development process has started, it is not possible to make changes under the waterfall model.

Customer involvement: throughout the development process, customers and stakeholders are involved in the agile model while waterfall has much less customer involvement.

Delivery Method: working software is delivered incrementally using the agile model, while waterfall delivers the final product at the end of the development process.

The agile method may be preferred in the scenario where there is a high likelihood of the requirements changing, need for collaboration and flexibility and frequent delivery matters.

The waterfall model may be preferred when there is low likelihood of change of requirements, such that the project has well-defined requirements and there is little likelihood of significant changes during the project. It is also preferred where a structured and predictable approach to development is desired.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements. It is the process of gathering, documenting, analyzing, and managing the requirements of a software system. It involves identifying and defining the needs, goals, constraints, and specifications of the software project. Of key importance is ensuring that these requirements are understood, agreed upon, and validated by stakeholders.

The requirements engineering process:
1. Elicitation:  involves gathering information about the needs and expectations of stakeholders.
2. Analysis: requirements are analyzed to identify common themes, prioritize needs.
3. Specification: they are documented in a formalized format, such as a requirements document.
4. Validation: The validated requirements are reviewed and validated by stakeholders to ensure that they accurately represent their needs
5. Management: Throughout the software development lifecycle, requirements must be managed and tracked to ensure that they remain current, relevant,

Requirements engineering importance in the software development lifecycle:
Software requirements engineering practices positively impact different aspects of software development
1. Project management - Correctly defined and documented requirements enable team members to establish clear project goals and scope enabling the project to run smoothly.
2. Coding - Well-defined requirements inform developers about how a system should work thus making coding more effective.
3. Testing - Requirements serve as a basis for creating test cases and scenarios to run effective tests thus of key importance in this aspect.


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?


Modularity in software design is aimed at creating software in a way that minimizes dependencies among the components of a system. It refers to the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller, independent components or modules that can be developed, tested, maintained, and reused separately. Each module encapsulates a specific set of functionalities, data, or operations, and interacts with other modules through well-defined interfaces

It improves maintainability through isolation of changes, clear separation of concerns, code reusability and through ease of upgrades and updates.
It improves scalability of software systems through independent development and deployment, modular growth, performance optimization and adaptability to new technologies.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Software testing ensures that the final product meets specified requirements and performs as expected.

Unit Testing aims to verify that individual units or components of the software function correctly.
Integration Testing aims to test the interactions and data flow between integrated units or components.
System Testing aims to validate the complete and integrated software system against the specified requirements.
Acceptance Testing aims to ensure the software meets the acceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems  are software tools that help manage changes to source code, documents, or any other set of files over time. They track modifications to files, allowing multiple contributors to collaborate on a project simultaneously while keeping a record of all changes made. They help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

Version control systems are important in software development because of the following benefits which they provide: history tracking, branching and merging, collaboration, backup and recovery, code review and quality assurance, traceability and auditing and continuous integration and deployment

Examples and features of popular version control systems:

Git: it is a version control system widely used for managing software development projects. It is popular for its speed, flexibility, and support for branching and merging workflows.

Subversion (SVN): It is a version control system that maintains a single repository containing the entire history of files. It is not as advanced as Git and is popular for its ease and simplicity.

Mercurial (Hg): It is similar to Git but has different underlying architecture.


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

The role of a software project manager has include analysis of project constraints, establishment the project objectives, coordination of the project's internal and external teams, construction of the project timelines and monitoring the project's key performance indicators.

Software project managers' key responsibilities are involved in project planning and scheduling, resource management, risk management, stakeholder communication, team leadership and motivation, quality assurance, change management, budget management, documentation and reporting, closure and evaluation.

Challenges faced in managing software projects include lack of accountability, unrealistic deadlines, risk management, scope creep,project management software, resource allocation, stakeholder engagement, budget constraints and communication.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is the modification of a software product after delivery. It involves the process of the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Its aim is improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, or boosting performance.

Different types of maintenance activities:
1. Corrective Maintenance main aim is fixing defects, bugs, or errors discovered in the software system after deployment. 
2. Adaptive Maintenance main aim is making changes to the software system to adapt it to changes in the environment
3.Perfective Maintenance main aim is  enhancing or optimizing the software system to improve its performance, efficiency and usability.
4. Preventive Maintenance main aim is  proactively identifying and addressing potential issues or vulnerabilities in the software system before they impact its functionality.

Maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle because it ensures long-term viability, optimizes performance and usability, mitigates risks and issues, supports business continuity and maximizes on Return on Investment (ROI)

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Ethical issues that software engineers might face algorithmic bias, privacy, intellectual property, accountability, data collection, overemphasis on features, production of customer data, additive design and honesty.

How software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work.
